        <h3>“WISHING WON’T MAKE IT SO”</h3>
        <p>In Rand’s philosophy, reality exists as an objective absolute, impervious to our wishes or desires. But our capacity for thought gives us the ability to understand reality and the choice to use this knowledge to create the new and the life-sustaining. “The power to rearrange the combinations of natural elements is the only creative power man possesses,” Rand writes. “It is an enormous and glorious power — and it is the only meaning of the concept ‘creative.’</p>

            <p>
                    The primacy of existence (of reality) is the axiom that existence exists, i.e., that the universe exists independent of consciousness (of any consciousness). . . . To grasp the axiom that existence exists, means to grasp the fact that nature, i.e., the universe as a whole, cannot be created or annihilated, that it cannot come into or go out of existence. Whether its basic constituent elements are atoms, or subatomic particles, or some yet undiscovered forms of energy, it is not ruled by a consciousness or by will or by chance, but by the Law of Identity. . . . Nature is the metaphysically given — i.e., the nature of nature is outside the power of any volition.
